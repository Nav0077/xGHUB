## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to your repo → Settings → Pages.
3. Select the branch (e.g., `main`) and folder (`/root`) as source.
4. Save it — your site will be live at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/xGHUB/`

### Fixing 404 on inner pages:
If you get a 404 on `game_page.html` or `leaderboard.html`, ensure:
- Links use relative paths like `./game_page.html`
- You deployed from the correct branch and folder

## 📌 Static vs Dynamic

- This is a **static website**, meaning it doesn't use server-side scripting (like PHP or Node.js).
- All content is pre-defined and rendered in the browser using HTML/CSS/JS.
